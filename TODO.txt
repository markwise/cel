remove list styling from split and cel elements that are lists
    padding, margins, list-style
    
find a way to not use important for removing cel widths in responsive

add in horizontal alignment with gaps
    remove white-space between elements
    
add display:block to split element

should I add position:relative to split or cels?

Explore using custom elements for internal applications.


<split>
    <cel></cel>
    <line>
    <cel></cel>
</split>

or

<layout class="split by:2">
    <cel></cel>
    <line>
    <cel></cel>
</layout>

not sure if we even need the class split here since that would be assummed with layout element
    
    
    
    
add support for 9 equal width columns


add support for 3 column layout variations
    by:1/2/1

        initially hidden (display:none) then shown
        inserted with innerHTML or appendChild
            when a node is inserted check cel lines length
    
    ability to style using border properties and background
        custom dotted cel lines
	    gradient cel lines

	explore using custom element for cel lines instead of applying the class

	    <divider>
	    <line>

    Be able to use cel lines with grid layouts
